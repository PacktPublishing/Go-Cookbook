Go (a.k.a. Golang) is a statically-typed programming language first developed at Google. It is derived from C with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types, and a large standard library.

func main() {
    if err := tempfiles.WorkWithTemp(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```
