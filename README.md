## About the Book
Go (a.k.a. Golang) is a statically-typed programming language first developed at Google. It is derived from C with additional features such as garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capabilities, additional built-in types, and a large standard library.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
package main
import "github.com/agtorre/go-cookbook/chapter1/tempfiles"
func main() {
    if err := tempfiles.WorkWithTemp(); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

To use this book, you’ll need the following:

A Unix programming environment
